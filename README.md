I WANT check the weather in any city in the world

WHEN i enter the name of the city i want to check

THEN website displays the weather information of that city. Including city name, country, temperature, weather, visibility, wind speed,humidity.

WHEN the city's temperature is below/above 32Â°F

THEN the background will change to a cold/hot image
